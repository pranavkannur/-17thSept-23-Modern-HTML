Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of 
HTML:
      1]Semantic HTML: Always use the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.
       Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud1.
       For example,if you need a button, use the <button> element (and not a <div> element).
       Semantic elements are elements with a meaning.

      2]Alternative Text: The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some 
      reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses
       a screen reader). The value of the alt attribute should describe the image.
       
      3]Proper Use of Headings: Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your 
      web pages. Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document 
      structure and the relationships between different sections1. Screen readers also use headings as a
      navigational tool.
      
These practices can significantly improve the accessibility of your HTML content.
