Web accessibility, in the context of web development, refers to the practice of designing and developing websites, tools,
and technologies in such a way that people with disabilities can use themMore specifically, it means that people can perceive,
understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, as well as contribute to it.Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities 
that affect access to the Web, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual impairments.
Creating accessible websites is essential for several 
reasons:
        1]Equal Access and Opportunity: The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, 
        employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in 
        order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities.

        2]Legal Obligations: Many countries have laws and regulations that require web accessibility.
        Non-compliance can lead to legal penalties.

        3]Improved User Experience: Accessible websites often provide a better user experience for all users. 
        For example, features designed for accessibility can also benefit people using mobile devices

Web accessibility benefits different user groups:

        1]People with Disabilities: Web accessibility primarily helps people with disabilities to use websites equally with abled users.

        2]Older People: As people age, they may experience changes in vision, hearing, and motor skills. Accessible websites can accommodate these changes

        3]People with Temporary or Situational Limitations: Someone with a broken arm or a parent holding a baby has a temporary limitation; someone in
        bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio has a situational limitation. Both can benefit from accessible web design.

        4]People Using Mobile Devices: Features designed for accessibility can benefit people using mobile phones, smartwatches, smart TVs, 
        and other devices with small screens or different input modes.

In conclusion, web accessibility is not only about disabled users but about making your website usable by as many people as possible.
Itâ€™s a practice that leads to better user experience and inclusivity.
